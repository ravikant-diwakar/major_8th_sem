# AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System for India

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-driven crop recommendation system specifically designed for Indian farmers. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes critical environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide district and month-specific crop recommendations. The primary goal is to empower farmers with data-driven insights, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability across diverse regions of India. The system ranks the best crops to plant based on the given conditions, ensuring informed decision-making for optimized farming practices.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, detect and handle outliers, normalize or standardize features, and encode categorical data.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models including Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Calculate accuracies for each crop.
- **Visualization**: Visualize model accuracies for each crop using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application on Streamlit Cloud for real-time crop recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the `Combined_Crop_recommendation.parquet` file in the same directory as `app.py`.

2. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Missing Data**: Identify and handle missing values appropriately.
- **Outliers**: Detect and handle outliers in the dataset to prevent skewed results.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize features to ensure that all inputs are on the same scale.
- **Encoding Categorical Data**: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones to better capture patterns in the data.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure that the model is evaluated on data it hasn't seen before, preventing overfitting.
- **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate machine learning model based on the problem you're solving.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model’s performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics. Use cross-validation to check the consistency of the model’s performance across different subsets of the data.
- **Model Interpretation**: Understand which features contribute most to the model’s predictions.

## Visualization

- **Model Accuracies**: Visualize the accuracies of all models for each crop using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Deployment

- **Streamlit Cloud**: Deploy the application on Streamlit Cloud for real-time crop recommendations.
